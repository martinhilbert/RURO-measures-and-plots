This code is a R implementation to produce the information theoretic measures and plots analyzed in:
    ##  Crutchfield & Feldman, (2003). Regularities Unseen, Randomness Observed ["RURO"]: Levels of entropy convergence. Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 13(1), 25-54.
The code allows to make RURO-style plots from time-series data  
The logic of the calculations is adapted from the Python library https://github.com/dit/dit ; Python package for information theory. http://docs.dit.io, 
We are thankful for the help and guidance of dit's author, Ryan James (https://github.com/Autoplectic)

* The script [RURO for Coding FINAL.R] runs the RURO code as in the paper (and produced its plots) 
* The script [RURO for Coding-with_bmu_categoricalfix.R] runs the same code, but also has the option to calculate the decompositions for b_mu,
